Note for youcompleteme to work you need a copy of vim that has python support. To test if your vim copy has python support, type vim --version | grep python and if it returns +python or +python3 it means it has python support. If not get a copy of vim with python support.

Youcomplete me installation instructions with vundle. 

1) add the following line to our vimrc at the vundle packages section.
	Plugin 'Valloric/YouCompleteMe'
2) exit vim and reopen vim. Then type :PluginInstall
3) youcompleteme package is cloned and installed but not configured properly yet.
4) next you need the clang library. The github page of youcompleteme recommends that we download the binaries from "http://releases.llvm.org/download.html" (the file is about 216 Mb). Goto the page and download the binaries.
	- sudo apt-get install clang-3.8 python3-dev (this worked for me though they recommend the below method)
				(or)
	- extract the binaries and install it
	- sudo tar -C /usr/local -xvf clang*.tar.xz
5) now goto .vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/
6) if your vim has only python3 support then type 
	- python3 install.py --clang-completer
   if that does not work they try with python2
	- ./install.py --clang-completer
7) now you need to install the configuration generator. Clone the repo. You can put it anywhere but for consistency put it at .vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/ folder
	- git clone https://github.com/rdnetto/YCM-Generator


Testing:
Note you need a proper working makefile for the project to make the autocompletion work

1) cd <project_directory>/
2) run ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/YCM-Generator/.config_gen.py . -c clang-3.8 (substitute it with your version of clang)
	This will look for a Makefile and automatically insert a .ycm*.py file that carries the custom configuration 
3) you cannot type the command in point 2 of testing all the time. To fix this add it as an alias to the .bashrc
