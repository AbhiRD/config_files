Amme Sharanam!

ngrok allows us to connect to a remote system over the internet like doing an ssh.
Download ngrok and run the binary file using the command

1) ./ngrok authtoken 3F3eLQRVsUG5gqVPTND3A_2vXXtPCjK3TnnEazxHE7a

This will enable the authentication token

2) make sure ssh you are able to connect to ssh locally

3) "./ngrok tcp 22" for tcp and "./ngrok http 80" for http. This should be done on the server.

4) On the client side "ssh uname@0.0.tcp.ngrok.io -p <port>". But its very slow.

5) to scp a file into a remote computer, "scp -P <port #> <filepath/on/local/pc> uname@0.tcp.ngrok.io:<filepath/on/remote/pc>"

6) to sshfs into a directory on a remote computer, "sshfs ram@0.tcp.ngrok.io:<path to remote directory> <path to local directory> -p <port #>"

tasks: ssh is very slow as it tries to update character by character. If this process can be done in chunks it will be so much more faster.
